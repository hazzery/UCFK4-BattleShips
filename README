ENCE260 Assignment - UC Fun Kit 4
Code written by Harrison Parkes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle Ships
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game opens to ship placement mode. Use the navswitch to move the ship to the desired position.
To toggle the ship between being placed vertically and horizontally, press Button1.
Once you are happy with the ship's placement, press down on the navswitch to confirm it's placement.
Repeat this process for the next three ships. Placing the last ship will clear the screen.

Once all ships are placed, place both Funk Kits together ready for Infra-Red communications.
The player that wishes to play first must press Button1 to confirm both players are ready.
This person is now referred to as Player1 from now on.
The two Fun Kits will then exchange ship placement information.

NOTE: Please Keep both Fun Kits in position for communications from this point on!

Once communication is complete, Player1's Fun Kit will move into aiming state.
The top left LED on the matrix will flash and the player can use the navswitch to choose where
they would like to fire. To confirm position, press down on the navswitch.
The LED will then stop flashing and will remain on until the game finishes.
If the shot was a hit, the blue LED wil flash on for a short period.
Player1's Fun Kit is now in waiting state and the navswitch will no longer do anything.

This marks the end of Player1's turn, and will allow Player2 to have theirs.
The game repeats as so until one person has hit all of the opposition's ships.
